      Once the design has been finalised manufacture can begin. This will
      require a 50% deposit paid in advance when the final design has been
      agreed. The deposit covers the cost of materials to be ordered, initial
      design time and the manufacture of the project. The remaining 50% of the
      project is then paid on completion. A minimum of 8 weeks is allocated for
      any project. Tighter timelines can be negotiated depending on the scale of
      the work required.
