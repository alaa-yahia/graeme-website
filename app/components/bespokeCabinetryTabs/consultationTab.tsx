      The best way to establish if a bespoke solution if right for you is an
      initial consultation, free of charge. This will normally be done over the
      phone and should take around 15mins. This conversation will briefly
      explore the needs of the space, timeline and budget. Once this is
      understood, an informal guideline quote can be provided - this also helps
      to outline a budget if you are unsure of how much a project will cost.
